# Technical Files for the CED Part of the Cranfield Coop Group

This folder contains the technical files for the Computational Engineering Division (CED) of the Cranfield Coop Group. It includes four main components:

## 1. Calculations

This section contains an Excel file used for:

- Calculating and obtaining the first space size for the meshes
- Determining the momentum sources of the simulations for each Reynolds number (Re).

## 2. Meshes

This folder includes all the meshes used within the simulations.

## 3. Simulations

This section contains the different simulations using both models. To run a simulation:

- Open Fluent.
- Read the journal file related to the simulation.
- The "(computed)" files are the case files saved after the simulation has run.
- The `Data` folder contains all the plots and data computed by the simulation.

## 4. Results

This folder contains:

- An Excel file comparing both models and the DNS results.
